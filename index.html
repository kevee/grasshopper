The three principles of Grasshopper are:</p><ol><li><strong>Fitness</strong> - During play, everyone should be sprinting. Each hop should end with all players panting.</li><li><strong>Equity</strong> - Rules should ensure fairness through assigning magic points to all players. Data science should inform changes to rules to ensure better equity.</li><li><strong>Chaos</strong> - Each play should be unpredictable and result in utter confusion.</li></ol><h2>Introductory video</h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAp-Zok8Ej4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Equipment</h2><p>To play Grasshopper, you will need:</p><ul><li><strong>Two tripods</strong> - Constructed with lashed together sticks, broken camera tripods you found in a dumpster, or any three things leaning against each other.</li><li><strong>Two soccer balls</strong> - It is better if the two balls are different colors. Designate one soccer ball the multiball.</li><li><strong>Frisbee</strong> - Any frisbee</li></ul><p>In addition, several kinds of <a href="#magic">rare magic</a> require additional equipment. These are optional.</p><h2>The playing field (pitch)</h2><p>A Grasshopper pitch is anywhere indoors or outdoors that is at least 45 meters by 30 meters.</p><p>The tripods should be placed 15 meters apart in the middle of the pitch. One of the tripods should be designated home for the bash bish. The opposite tripod should have the multiball under it. Draw a line in the ground 5 meters from the opposite tripod and 10 meters from the home tripod. This is the bowl line.</p><p>The areas of the pitch are:</p><ul><li><strong>The barley</strong> - The area between the two tripods. The bash bish runs between the two tripods in the barley.</li><li><strong>Zola</strong> - The area 180 degrees behind the bash bish.</li><li><strong>The beanie</strong> - The area 180 degrees in front of the bash bish.</li></ul><h2>Positions</h2><p>Players take turns rotating positions between:</p><ul><li><strong>Bash bish</strong> - The only player (besides a bettlejuice) who can score during a hop. The bash bish stands at the home tripod until play begins.</li><li><strong>Fans</strong> - (Only if needed) - Players who are awaiting return to play, who must scream and yell during play.</li><li><strong>Zola</strong> - Fielder directly behind the bash bish. There can be multiple zolas.</li><li><strong>Right beanie</strong> - Fielder to the bash bish's right in the beanie.</li><li><strong>Left beanie</strong> - Fielder to the bash bish's left in the beanie.</li><li><strong>Rolly polly</strong> - The player who rolls the soccer ball to the bash bish.</li></ul><h3>Four players</h3><p>If there are only four players, the Zola is no longer a fielder position, and the bash bish cannot kick the soccer ball or throw the frisbee behind them for the initial kick-off.</p><h3>More than five players</h3><p>If there are more than five players, keep adding them as fielder positions until it is no longer fun, or is impossible for the bash bish to score. At that point, rotate players from Bash Bish to being the fans.</p><p>Fans are required to do a steamroll if any player is brooked. They are also required to be roudy and yell a lot during play.</p><p>When summer rules are in effect, then fans are required to sit in the kiddie pool.</p><h2>Magic points</h2><p>Before play, each player's lifetime magic index must be either computed or looked up on the official Grasshopper website. A player's magic point is the mean lifetime score, derived by dividing their lifetime score by the number of games they played.</p><p>The player with the <em>highest</em> magic index gets <strong>one</strong> magic point. The player with the <em>lowest</em> magic score gets <strong>three</strong> magic points. All other players get <strong>two</strong> magic points.</p><h2>Play</h2><p>Grasshopper is played and scored using sets and hops.</p><h3>Games, sets, and hops</h3><p>Each game of Grasshopper consists of sets of hops. Each player gets to be the bash bish, at which point they have an opportunity to score. With the exception of the beetlejuice rule, players can only score points during their hop. Once every player has been the bash bish once, a new set starts.</p><p>Games can be as many sets and players would like, but you must complete any set you start. This ensures everyone has a chance to score in a set.</p><h3>The hop</h3><p>At the start of a hop, the bash bish stands at the hope tripod, and the rolly polly stands at the opposite tripod. Once all players are in position and ready, the rolly polly must hold the soccer ball high and yell &quot;Rolly polly!&quot;</p><h4>Bowling</h4><p>The rolly polly runs towards the bash bish and must bowl the soccer ball towards the bash bish before crossing the bowl line.</p><p>A bowled soccer ball must be rolled along the ground in the direction of the home tripod. It must not bounce excessively. If the bash bish decides the bowl is in a ridiculous angle or is bouncing excessively, they may call the bowl as incorrect before trying to kick it, and before the ball passes them.</p><p>If the bowl is declared incorrect, and the bash bish has not already tried to kick it, then the ball is returned to the rolly polly and the hop starts over.</p><h4>Bash bish starts play</h4><p>The bash bish must throw the frisbee in any direction, unless there are only four players, which case they must throw it in front of the home tripod. The frisbee should be thrown before kicking the soccer ball. Once the soccer ball is touched, the bowl is considered correct.</p><h4>Scoring</h4><p>The bash bish must run between both tripods to score points. Every time they touch or get very close to a tripod, they get one point.</p><h4>Magic spells</h4><p>At any point between the time the ball is released by the rolly polly and the bash bish is out, they may use a magic point if they have one available. They have to incant a magic by yelling its name as loudly as possible. Players may not reuse magic spells more than once in a game.</p><ul><li><strong>Beetlejuice</strong> - Must be called before a fielder has touched the soccer ball. The first player to the soccer ball after calling Beetlejuice becomes &quot;juiced.&quot; Juiced players act as defenders for the bash bish:<ul><li>They try to prevent the bash bish from being out.</li><li>They may only kick the soccer ball only after it has been touched by another fielder.</li><li>At the end of the hop, the bash bish recieves 20% of bash bish's points for that hop.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Grapevine</strong> - All players who are not the bashbish may only move by doing a grapevine dance (passing the feet side to side, one in front of the other)</li><li><strong>Multiball</strong> - The bash bish, upon reaching the opposite tripod, can pick up the extra soccer ball and kick it in any direction. The bash bish is now not out until the multiball also reaches one of the tripods.</li></ul><h5>Rare Magic</h5><p>Rare magic can be created by any league as long as it enhances the three core tenants of Grasshopper, and involves objects that the league found just laying around. The following rare magics have been used in prior games:</p><ul><li><strong>Blue Light Special</strong> - If a shopping cart is available, you may place it near the barley at an equilateral triangle 5 meters from the middle of the barley, with the corners of the triangle being the tripods. If Blue Light Special is called, the defense can not touch the soccer ball, and must instead push the cart to the soccer ball, place it in the the cart, and then roll the cart to a tripod.</li></ul><h4>Out</h4><p>The hop proceeds until the bash bish is out. To get a bash bish out, the fielders must get the frisbee under one tripod, and the soccer ball in the other. If multiball was called, the multiball must also arrive to one of the tripods.</p><p>If either the frisbee or soccer ball is under control of a fielder when it is placed under a tripod, then it is considered &quot;locked.&quot; Locked balls or frisbees cannot be moved by the bash bish or beetlejuice. Multiballs are always &quot;locked&quot; and never have to be moved once arriving at a tripod.</p><p>If a locked ball or frisbee is under a tripod, and the other object is brought to the tripod, the incoming item is not considered locked until the original item is removed.</p></main></body></html>
