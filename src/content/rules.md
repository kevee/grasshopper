Run between two tripods made of sticks more times than your friends!

Play starts with the Roly Poly rolling a soccer ball to the Bashbish. Before the ball is kicked the Bashbish must throw a frisbee as far as possible in any direction. The Bashbish then kicks the ball as far as possible in any direction. Once these objects have been dispatched... run! The Bashbish runs as fast as possible between the tripods until the Fielders are able to assemble at least one object at each tripod. This completes one Hop. Now the Roly Poly is the new Bashbish, and a Fielder becomes the new Roly Poly. A round consists of one Hop per player. Typical games are played to 3 rounds, the player with the most points wins!

### Defense

The bash bish may at any time interfere with the soccerball. They may only touch the ball once after the ball has been touched by a defender. The Bash Bish May leave the barley to do so.

### Object safety

An out is achieved when the frisbee and soccer ball are under both tripods, where the ball is under one tripod, and the frisbee is is under the other. If he multiball has been played, an out is reached by affing the multiball to either tripod.

If an object is in control when it is placed under a tripod, it is considered "safe" and the bash bish can not interfere with it.

If one object is safe at a tripod and another object is added to the tripod, the incoming item is not considered safe until the original item is removed.

## Positions

- **Roly Poly** - Rolls the soccer ball to the batsman. Play starts when the Roly Poly begins to approach the batsman.
- **Bashbish** - This is the only player on offense. The Bashbish makes the first throw of the frisbee and kicks the soccer ball. Also summons magic.
- **Fielders** - These players retrieve the soccer ball(s) and frisbee. Their goal is to return all items to the same tripod. The Roly Poly becomes a Fielder immediately upon rolling the soccer ball. Fielders can play in one of three zones, which are as follows:
  - **The Zola** - behind the Bashbish
  - **The Beanie** - behind and to the left of the Rolly Polly
  - **The Faery** - behind and to the right of the Rolly Polly
- **Dogs** - Occasionally get in the way. This is fine.

## The field

The game is focused around two tripods made of sticks set up 15 paces apart. Between the two tripods there is the Throw Line. The Roly Poly must release the soccer before reaching the Throw Line. The Throw Line is located 10 paces away from the Bashbish's tripod.

A diagram of the various portions of the field is below.

## Equipment

One soccer ball and one frisbee are standardz with one additional soccer ball for magic. Tripods are constructed from sticks and vines. Music speaker also ideal.

## Scoring

One point is scored per tripod visited before the tripods "die." Tripod death occurs when all objects have been returned to a tripod, and both tripods have at least one object.

A game is finished when the players are exhausted, everyone is hungry, or someone is seriously injured.

For the purposes of calculating the _magic index_, a "game" is considered 3 rounds, and any game with over or under 3 rounds is calculated by divding that game by three.

At the declared end of the game, scores are added together. Highest score wins the game!

## Magic

Players who are playing their _first game_ of Grasshopper all start with two magic spells. These spells may be called at any time while the player is the bashbish, after the ball is kicked, and before they are out.

When players wake up the next morning, whomever has the highest score has only _one_ magic spell, while the lowest-scoring player has _three_ magic spells.

### Magic spells

The following magic incantations can be cast at any point during play by the bashbish:

- **Beetlejuice, beetlejuice, beetlejuice, [other player's name]** - After calling "Beetlejuice" thrice, the bashbish names an opponent. That opponent then tries their hardest to _prevent_ a ball or frisbee from reaching a tripod. The "juiced" player may knock down balls, slap frisbees, or otherwise confuse the other players, but may not kick the ball or throw the frisbee.
- **Grapevine** - All players who are not the bashbish may only move by doing a grapevine dance (passing the feet side to side, one in front of the other)
- **Multiball** - The bashbish, upon reaching the opposite tripod, can pick up the extra soccer ball and kick it in any direction. That ball is now required to reach the same tripod as the main soccer ball and frisbee before the batter is considered out.

#### Rare Magic

- **Blue Light Special** - If a shopping cart is available, you may place it near the barley at an equilateral triangle 5 meters from the middle of the barley, with the corners of the triangle being the tripods. If Blue Light Special is called, the defense can not touch the soccer ball, and must instead push the cart to the soccer ball, place it in the the cart, and then roll the cart to a tripod.

## Details

- Objects must remain in the square around the triood. Players may not intentionally remove them.
- When ball is bowled outside tripod boundary, the bashbish can call a re-bowl, kick it and run as normal, or let it pass and simply begin running.
